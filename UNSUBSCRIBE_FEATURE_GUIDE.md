# Unsubscribe Feature - User Guide

## What's New

Users with active subscriptions can now unsubscribe directly from their profile with a clear confirmation dialog.

## Where to Find It

1. Click the **profile icon** (user avatar) in the top-right corner of the header
2. The User Profile modal will open
3. If you have an active subscription, you'll see:
   - Subscription status: "✓ Active ($39/year)"
   - An **"Unsubscribe"** button (yellow/warning color)

## How It Works

### Step 1: Open Profile
Click your profile icon in the header to open the profile modal.

### Step 2: View Subscription Status
The modal shows:
- Your email
- Member since date
- Email verification status
- **Subscription status** (Active or No active subscription)

### Step 3: Click Unsubscribe
If subscribed, click the yellow **"Unsubscribe"** button.

### Step 4: Confirmation Popup
A beautiful confirmation modal appears with:
- ⚠️ Warning icon
- Title: **"Cancel Subscription?"**
- Message: "Are you sure you want to cancel your subscription? You will lose access to unlimited travel briefs."
- Two buttons:
  - **"Keep Subscription"** (gray) - Cancels the unsubscribe action
  - **"Yes, Unsubscribe"** (yellow) - Confirms unsubscription

### Step 5: Confirm or Cancel
- Click **"Keep Subscription"** → Nothing happens, modal closes, subscription remains active
- Click **"Yes, Unsubscribe"** → Proceeds with cancellation

### Step 6: Processing
When you confirm:
- Button text changes to **"Processing..."**
- Button is disabled during the request
- Backend cancels your subscription

### Step 7: Success
On successful cancellation:
- ✓ Green success message appears: "Subscription cancelled successfully"
- Subscription status updates to "No active subscription"
- Profile modal automatically closes after 3 seconds
- You immediately lose access to subscription-only features

### Error Handling
If something goes wrong:
- Red error message displays with specific details
- You can try again
- Your subscription remains active if cancellation fails
