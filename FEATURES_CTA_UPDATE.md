# FEATURES_CTA_UPDATE.md

## Implementation Summary

Updated the Features page CTA card to use the beach image background with homepage hero overlay and corrected spacing alignment.

## Files Modified

### `src/components/CTAFeatures.tsx`
- **Background**: Replaced gradient with beach image (`/saud-edum-ECteVg5suUg-unsplash.jpg`)
- **Overlay**: Added identical overlay from homepage hero (`bg-black bg-opacity-60`)
- **Structure**: Converted to layered approach with absolute positioning for image and overlay

### `src/pages/Features.tsx`
- **Spacing**: Adjusted CTA wrapper margin from `mb-16` to `mt-16` to match page section rhythm
- **Positioning**: Moved CTA outside the main content container to align with page structure

## Exact Classes Changed

### Spacing:
- **Before**: `<div className="mb-16">` (bottom margin)
- **After**: `<div className="mt-16">` (top margin matching other sections)

### Background:
- **Before**: `bg-gradient-to-r from-[#2563EB] to-[#8B5CF6]` (purple gradient)
- **After**: 
  ```jsx
  <div
    className="absolute inset-0 bg-cover bg-center bg-no-repeat"
    style={{ backgroundImage: 'url(/saud-edum-ECteVg5suUg-unsplash.jpg)' }}
  />
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-60" />
  ```

### Image Path:
- **Image**: `/saud-edum-ECteVg5suUg-unsplash.jpg` (existing beach image from public folder)

### Overlay Classes:
- **Identical to homepage hero**: `bg-black bg-opacity-60`
- **Positioning**: `absolute inset-0` with `aria-hidden="true"`
