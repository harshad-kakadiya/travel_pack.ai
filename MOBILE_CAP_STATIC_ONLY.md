# MOBILE_CAP_STATIC_ONLY.md

## Implementation Summary

Applied mobile cap of 2 example cards per persona only to the static Examples page (`/examples`). The Step-2 checkout flow remains completely unchanged.

## Files Modified

### `src/pages/Examples.tsx`
- Added conditional `hidden sm:block` classes to example cards with index >= 2
- Uses Tailwind responsive utilities to hide cards 3+ on mobile (≤sm width)
- Shows all cards on tablet and desktop (≥sm width)

## Implementation Details

### Approach Used
- **Tailwind responsive classes**: Applied `hidden sm:block` to cards with index >= 2
- **Conditional rendering**: Used template literal with ternary operator to conditionally apply classes
- **Index-based targeting**: Cards at positions 0 and 1 always visible, cards 2+ hidden on mobile only

### Code Pattern
```jsx
className={`base-classes ${
  index >= 2 ? 'hidden sm:block' : ''
}`}
```

## Verification Checklist

### Mobile Behavior (≤640px width):
- [ ] `/examples` shows exactly 2 cards per persona section
- [ ] Cards 3, 4, 5+ are hidden on mobile
- [ ] Layout remains clean and properly spaced
- [ ] All other content (headers, testimonials, CTA) displays normally

### Desktop Behavior (≥640px width):
- [ ] `/examples` shows all 5 cards per persona section
- [ ] No cards are hidden
- [ ] Grid layout displays properly across all breakpoints

### Step-2 Checkout Flow:
- [ ] `/examples-checkout-step` behavior is completely unchanged
- [ ] All cards display as they did before (no mobile cap applied)
- [ ] Checkout flow navigation and guards work normally
- [ ] No Step-2 files were modified

### Navigation:
- [ ] Navbar "Examples" link goes to `/examples` (static page)
- [ ] Static page CTA "Start your Travel Brief" goes to `/plan`
- [ ] Checkout flow continues to use `/examples-checkout-step`

## Safety Verification

### Files NOT Modified:
- `src/pages/ExamplesCheckoutStep.tsx` - No changes to Step-2 behavior
- `src/App.tsx` - No route changes needed (routes already exist)
- `src/components/Header.tsx` - No navigation changes needed
- Any other checkout flow components

### Scope Compliance:
✅ Only modified the static Examples page file
✅ No shared components were altered
✅ No Step-2 files were touched
✅ Used Tailwind responsive utilities (no custom CSS needed)
✅ Maintained identical content and styling
✅ Applied mobile cap through visibility control only

## Technical Implementation

### Responsive Breakpoints:
- **Mobile (sm and below)**: `≤639px` - Shows 2 cards per persona
- **Tablet and up (sm and above)**: `≥640px` - Shows all cards per persona

### CSS Classes Applied:
- `hidden`: Hides element completely
- `sm:block`: Shows element as block starting at sm breakpoint (640px+)
- Combined: `hidden sm:block` = hidden on mobile, visible on tablet+

### Performance Impact:
- Minimal: Cards are rendered but hidden via CSS
- No JavaScript filtering or dynamic rendering
- Maintains React key stability and component lifecycle
