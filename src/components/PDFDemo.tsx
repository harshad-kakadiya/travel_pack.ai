      destination: 'Oaxaca & Surrounding Regions, Mexico',
      duration: '8 Days',
      destinationIntroduction: `Oaxaca represents Mexico's cultural heart, where experienced travelers can engage with indigenous traditions, complex culinary arts, and artisan crafts that have remained unchanged for centuries. This UNESCO World Heritage city rewards those who approach it with cultural sensitivity and genuine curiosity.

The region's food culture extends far beyond typical Mexican cuisine into the realm of high art. Seven different moles, traditional mezcal production, and indigenous market systems create opportunities for deep cultural engagement that experienced travelers can appreciate and navigate respectfully.

Oaxaca's surrounding villages and archaeological sites offer experienced travelers access to living indigenous cultures and pre-Columbian history. Understanding local customs, market etiquette, and the significance of traditional crafts transforms this from a tourist destination into a profound cultural exchange.`,

The Ring Road and F-roads provide access to landscapes that seem otherworldly - active volcanoes, massive glaciers, and geothermal features that demonstrate the planet's raw power. Adventure travelers must understand 4WD techniques, emergency shelter, and weather monitoring to safely explore these remote regions.

Iceland's isolation means self-reliance is critical.
